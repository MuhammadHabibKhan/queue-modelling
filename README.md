# Queue Modelling 

Calculates Length of Queue (Lq), Wait in Queue (Wq), Length of System (Ls), Wait in System (Ws) and Server Utilization

Input required : InterArrival and Service Distribution with their mean

#### Built using React JS

Created as a sub project for course BSCS-507 Operations Research

## Pre-Reqs:

1) 'npm install' to download node modules
2) 'npm start' to run the project
3) default port 3000

## Possible Improvements:

No warning or handling for Little's Law where if service mean exceeds inter arrival mean, then queue may be infinitely long, resulting in infinite values.
